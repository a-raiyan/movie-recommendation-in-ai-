# Project Title: Delivering Personalized Movie Recommendations with an AI-Driven Matchmaking System

---

### 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging a **US movies dataset**, it utilizes AI-driven matchmaking systems and combines **Random Forest** and **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** to classify and suggest movies based on user preferences. The system integrates both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance. The entire system is developed in Google Colab for easy experimentation and testing.

### 🎯 Objectives

- **Personalized Recommendations**: To build a recommendation system that delivers tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and historical data.
- **AI-Powered Matchmaking**: To implement an AI-based matchmaking system using **Random Forest** and **SVM** to predict user preferences and movie compatibility.
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combine **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** to enhance the quality and accuracy of the recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Test and compare the performance of **Random Forest** and **SVM** on movie recommendation accuracy.
- **User Interface**: Optionally, create an interactive web-based interface for users to input preferences and receive movie suggestions.
- **Google Colab Support**: Ensure that the project is compatible with **Google Colab** for ease of deployment and accessibility.
